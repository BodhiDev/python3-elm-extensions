# Support This Project

This module is part of our current project to convert all the Bodhi Linux python-efl code to python3 as python2 is currently depreciated.

Donations to [Bodhi Linux](https://www.bodhilinux.com/donate/) would be greatly appreciated and keep our distro moving along. But if you like the work we do for Bodhi and wish to see more of it, we'd be happy about a donation. You can donate via [PayPall](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/rbtylee). If you mention this module, we will forward the donation to Å tefan 'the waiter' Uram as he did most of the initial developement work involved.
